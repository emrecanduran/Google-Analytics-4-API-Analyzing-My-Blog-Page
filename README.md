# Google-Analytics-4-API-Analyzing-My-Blog-Page

## My Blog Page: emrecanduran.com Data 

In this repository, I performed an analysis of my blog page 6 months data from a Google Analytics 4 (GA4) account using Google Cloud services within a Jupyter notebook. The aim of this project is to leverage my knowledge of GA4 in conjunction with my proficiency in Jupyter notebooks to conduct an analysis. 

By adjusting dimensions and, metrics or creating new ones a wider range of analyses can be conducted. Individuals familiar with GA4 reports can similarly perform analyses to a certain extent. This method may be preferred to expand the manipulation area of ga4 e-commerce data.
